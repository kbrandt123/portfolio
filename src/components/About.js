        I am a fully self-taught full-stack developer with no prior coding
        expereince! Many of my projects are built with React.js, Node.js, MySQL
        and more! I am always improving my current skillset and learning new
        technologies every day. When I'm not programming, I like to either be
        socializing at my local coffee shop, training Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, or
        chatting with my friends on Discord.
